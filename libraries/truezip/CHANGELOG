ChangeLog
========================

TrueZip v7
----------
Grabbed from https://hg.java.net/hg/truezip~v7 (r6207).
The source was downgraded to fully comply with JS6 and remove NIO2/ServiceLocator/Swing/Console
support and stripped down to use the minimal subset of classes to run RAES engine. Removed
javax/findBugs annotations. This port doesn't contain any driver or keyprovider registered
as default. Default locators doesn't return any implementation. Implementators should
define its own set of fsdrivers and keyproviders.

BouncyCastle (Lightweight API)
------------------------------
Grabbed from source version lcrypto-jdk15on-151.
Only contains the crypto classes requiered by TrueZip.
Change namespace from org.bouncycastle to securespace.lcrypto to avoid
namespace conflicts.

Commons Compress (Bzip2)
------------------------
Grabbed from source version 1.9.
Only contains Bzip2 compressor engine.
Change namespace from org.apache.commons.compress to securespace.compress to avoid
namespace conflicts.
