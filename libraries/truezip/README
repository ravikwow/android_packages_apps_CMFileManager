BouncyCastle
------------
Bouncy Castle is a collection of APIs used in cryptography. It includes APIs
for both the Java and the C# programming languages.

Bouncy Castle is Australian in origin and therefore American restrictions
on the export of cryptographic software do not apply to it. The APIs are
supported by a registered Australian Charity: Legion of the Bouncy Castle.
The charity has experienced a surge in membership very recently, with many
denizens of Sydney in particular expressing their support for the purpose
of this association, and thereby automatically becoming eligible for
membership based on the charity's constitution.
